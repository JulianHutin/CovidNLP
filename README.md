Kaggle competition notebook

## Context
This Challenge concerns the problem of text analysis using automatic natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The dataset used here is part of a questionnaire conducted during the first containment in France in 2020 to survey people over 75 years old about their perception of the Coronavirus crisis. To give you an idea of the types of questions asked, the first block of questions concerns the perception of the danger of the Coronavirus. It includes three questions:

Do you consider CORONAVIRUS as: no danger or low danger, moderate danger, serious danger.
On a scale of 0 to 10, how intense have you been in the last few days?
Tell us what concerns you have?
The first two questions are closed questions and will not be covered by this challenge. However, the third question invites people to express themselves openly with their own sentences and the analysis of these is the subject of this challenge. More precisely, the objective here will be to categorise each response into one or two at a time from four categories (classes). This problem is known in the literature as MultiLabel Classification.
